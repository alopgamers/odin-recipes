    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
              
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).</li>
        <LI>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturersâ€™ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.</LI>
    </ol>
